# CinemaDatabase
CinemaDatabase is my university project. It's an Oracle database for a single cinema.

## Usage

Frist clone the repository, then in Oracle SQL Developer launch the installation script "PROJECT_INSTALL.sql" by executing command:
@"<your_path>/PROJECT_INSTALL.sql". For example: @"C:\temp\PROJECT_INSTALL.sql". Afterwards on the left hand side you should be able to see created tables,
with seeded data, sequencers and views.

If you wish to deinstall the database you can use script "PROJECT_DEINSTALL.sql". To launch the script follow the same procedure as with installation script.
